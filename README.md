# Happy Phone Bot
A Discord bot i made that is called "Happy Phone".

This discord bot is made with Bun.JS v1.2.5.

Dependencies: || discord.js || discordjs/rest || dotenv (not really required, but the package.json has it so) || keyv || pagination.djs (i think that you need to run ```bun install``` to install all dependencies automatically).

After you've installed Dependencies, run ```bun run ./bot.js```. Make sure to enter your discord bot Token and Client ID and change .env.example to .env.local.
